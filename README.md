# About
I am a web developer and designer with a passion for creating and maintaining web applications. 

I have a computer science associateâ€™s degree from SUNY Herkimer CCC, where I learned various programming languages and technologies, such as Java, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

I have also worked on several projects that demonstrate my skills and creativity, such as TinDog, a social media website for dogs and their owners, 
Clear-100k-Data Project, a Java program that efficiently sorts large sets of data, and MoveIt, a web application for a small moving company.
